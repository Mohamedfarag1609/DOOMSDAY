# Assembly Date Calculator

## Description

This assembly language program is a simple date calculator that takes user input for the day, month, and year
and calculates the day of the week for that date. The program uses the "Doomsday Algorithm" to determine the day of the week.

## How to Use

1. Run the program.
2. Enter the day when prompted.
3. Enter the month when prompted.
4. Enter the year when prompted.

The program will then display the calculated day of the week for the provided date.

## Doomsday Algorithm

The Doomsday Algorithm is used to calculate the day of the week for any given date.
It involves determining the anchor day for the century and using it to find the doomsday for the year.

The program then processes the input month and adjusts for leap years to arrive at the final result.
